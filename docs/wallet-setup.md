## Wallet setup

Two important commands are `btcli wallet list` and `btcli wallet overview`. 

The first enables one to vizualize their wallets in a tree-like manner as well as which hotkeys are associated with a given coldkey. Importantly, one can see the wallet name that is associated with each pair of coldkey and hotkey. This is important since the names of the coldkey and the hotkey are used rather than the keys themselves when running bittensor commands related to wallets.  

The second enables one to see the subnets in which their wallet is registered as well as the wallet's balance.
